    <p>ðŸ”­  In 2020 I decided to make a career change, I was on an administrative job and started to build scripts for my spreadsheets to optimize my time and reduce errors, the coding part of the job was my favorite, and building tools to become more productive was something amazing. When the pandemic came and we all went remote, suddenly I had all the time I needed to dedicate to my passion, I started studying front-end development and never stopped. Since then I've had the privilege to deliver various exciting projects that helped businesses streamline new products, improve SEO, and boost their income and overall performance.</p>
    <p>ðŸŒ± Currently I'm focused on becoming a frontend specialist, but I'm always studying new things like mobile and backend development.</p>
